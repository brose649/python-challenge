# python-challenge
This is the repository for the Module 3 homework of the Data Analytics Boot Camp.

There were two parts to this module. 1) Create a Python script to analyze the financial records of the mock company, PyBank. 2) Help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

This was an introduction into Python. While I am beginning to get the hang of some of the syntax, there were certain parts where I relied on the Xpert Learning Assistant. This challenge has shown me the importance of reading and studying as much Python code as possible. I particularly enjoyed learning how to export results from a python script directly into a .txt file, in addition to learning some formatting tricks. Looking forward to the Pandas module.
