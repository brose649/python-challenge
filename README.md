# python-challenge
This is the repository for the Module 3 homework of the Data Analytics Boot Camp

There were two parts to this module. For one we were tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a mock company. For the other we were tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

This was an introduction into python. While I am beginning to get the hang of some of the syntax, there were certain parts where I relied on the Xpert Learning Assistant. This challenge has shown me the importance of reading and studying as much python code as possible. I particularly enjoyed learning how to export results from a python script directly into a txt file, in addition to learning some formattin tricks. Looking forward to the pandas module.
